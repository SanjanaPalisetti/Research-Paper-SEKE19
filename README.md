# An Empirical Study on Managing Energy and Accuracy Requirements of Location Based Android Applications
This research paper was accepted by and presented at the [International Conference on Software Engineering & Knowledge Engineering (SEKE) 2019](http://ksiresearch.org/seke/seke19.html).

# Abstract
The improper use of GPS and location-related APIs may result in abnormal battery drain in Android applications. Over the last few years, the developers’ discussions on improving energy efficiency have increased. In this paper, we mine [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) to analyze and summarize the characteristics of developers’ discussions of managing energy and accuracy-related requirements of location-based Android applications. We extracted 11,911 questions from StackOverflow and filtered 320 relevant questions to answer four research questions. We conducted a manual _thematic analysis_ of relevant questions. Our study shows that the developers are concerned about energy consumption, but are unclear about their preferences as energy and accuracy evolved as conflicting requirements.

# Approach
The data presented in StackOverflow is availble as a data dump at the [StackExchange Data Explorer](https://data.stackexchange.com). We extracted the data by composing and running an [SQL Query](/SQLQuery.docx).
